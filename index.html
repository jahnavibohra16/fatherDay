                        Dad, you're my friend, my guiding light,<br>
                        With you, every day feels perfectly bright.<br>
                        Your patience and understanding, beyond compare,<br>
                        You’ve always known my heart, with utmost care.<br>
                        When I felt lost, you held my hand,<br>
                        Your faith in me helped me to stand.<br>
                        Your encouragement turns dreams to reality,<br>
                        To make you proud is my biggest priority.<br>
                        Dad, you're not just a father, but a true friend too,<br>
                        Life’s journey is beautiful, all because of you.
